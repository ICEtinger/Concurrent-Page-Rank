Created by Isak C. Etinger.

Last updated April 2017.

This class provides a Runnable that uses the Page Rank algorithm to calculate centralities of Nodes in a graph.
It receives a collection containing all the Nodes that should have their centralities calculated and one of the 6 types of centrality
specified at centralityType.java to calculate (namely Standard, Reversed, Neighbor, and their versions with unweighted edges).

It distributes the collection of Nodes received into disjoint subarrays (each Node is contained by exactly 1 subarray),
and calls the Runnable in Iterate.java class to each one of them iterate over their respective subarray of Nodes. It then periodically 
measures the mean relative improvement on the centrality (since the last time it was checked) over all nodes. And if that measure is
below a specified value for a specified number of consecutive assessments, it causesthe running Iterate threads to stop. This is due
to the convergence of the centrality calculated at each iteration of the Page Rank algorithm.
