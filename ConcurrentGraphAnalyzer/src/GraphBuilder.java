Reads a CSV file and builds a graph from it. 
The form of the CSV file is: each line = "email identifier, ?, email address, from/to/cc", that indicates the email "email identifier"
is sent from (if from) or to (if to/cc) the email address "email address".

Fills the dictionary mapping the Strings of the email addresses to their respective Nodes representing them in the graph (variable "dic").

Optionally, fills a map (variable named "emails") in which each pair <String,List<Node> represents as key a String of an email identifier 
and as value a list of Nodes present in that email (either as sender or as receiver of the email).
